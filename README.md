# Waffles

Inspired by a cool layout I found, this is just a basic bottomsheet fragment with some UI work

# Summary
Another project where I thought the UI was really cool, so I just tried to copy it into android. Nothing more to it. Who doesn't like waffles and ice cream ?

# How it's done
Just some material components, a bottomsheet fragment with some guidelines to keep everything together.

# How would you run this ? 
You can simply clone this from github and open the project using android studio, no functionality though
